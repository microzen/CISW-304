                <span class="info">Quiche! What a throwback. This amazingly versatile savory pie first surfaced in an American magazine in 1941, according to Sylvia Lovegren's Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads, and rose in popularity through the '50s. People
                    loved it because it was a good way to get rid of leftovers, it was a vehicle for creativity, and it was French, which meant it was chic and sophisticated. By the '70s, you could find some form of quiche (but especially quiche Lorraine)
                    on nearly every restaurant and catering menu in America.</span>
